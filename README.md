# John Trivialta 

## Overview
This is a group project we did at the Futureproof bootcamp. The aim was to create a quiz web app that retrieved its questions from the Open Trivia API.

## User stories:
* As a user, when I want to play a quiz, I need an interface that gives me a quiz
* As a user, when I want to play a particular quiz category, I should be able to choose from a list of categories
* As a user, when I want a certain level of difficulty on my quiz, I should be able to choose how difficult it is
* As a user, when I click a answer, it should tell me if I was right or wrong (via colour green for correct/red for wrong)
* As a user, so I can get the next question, I want to click a button to do this
* As a user, when I play the quiz, I should be able to track what question I am on
* As a user, when I play the quiz, I want to be able to play against a friend
* As a user, when I finish the quiz, at the end of the quiz it should tell me my score
* As a user, when if I play with a friend, at the end of the quiz it should tell me who has won the quiz
* As a user, if I want to abandon my quiz, I can redirect back to the homepage to start a new one


## Layout:
* Landing page: a page where you are able to set up your test 
* Quiz page: a page which shows the question and a set of answers
* Results page: A page which shows the result of quiz


## Methodology:
* Daily standups
* Planning & replanning
* Coding
* Bug fixing & testing


## Technologies used:
* JavaScript
* JSX / CSS
* React / React Router DOM
* Git / Github
* Enzyme / Jest


## Reflections:
This was an enjoyable project that allowed us to become more confident in using APIs and making single page React applications. We also learn how to implement tests for a React project.

If we had more time, we would have sought to:
* add the option of a 2nd human player (either as a split screen or alternating screens)
* add user authentication / login
* implement high score feature
* increase test coverage from 60% to at least 80%
